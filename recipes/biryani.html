    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Cups Basmati Rice</li>
        <li>500 Kg Chicken</li>
        <li>1 Cup Yogurt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
        <li>Juice of half a lemon</li>
        <li>2 large Onions</li>
        <li>2 Tomatoes</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped coriander leaves</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped mint leaves</li>
        <li>2-3 tablespoons cooking oil or ghee</li>
        <li>A few strands of saffron soaked in 2 tablespoons warm milk (optional)</li>
        <li>Fried onions </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the chicken:In a bowl, mix chicken with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, salt, and lemon juice. Cover and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes (longer for better flavor).</li>
        <li>Cook the rice:Boil water with bay leaf, cloves, cardamoms, cinnamon, and salt. Add washed basmati rice and cook until it's 70–80% done (grains should still be firm). Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Fry the onions:In a deep pan or biryani pot, heat oil or ghee. Add sliced onions and fry until golden brown. Remove half for garnishing later.</li>
        <li>Cook the chicken:In the same pan, add chopped tomatoes to the remaining onions. Cook until soft. Add the marinated chicken and cook until the chicken is tender and oil starts to separate.</li>
<li>Layer the biryani:Lower the heat. Spread half the cooked rice over the chicken. Sprinkle some mint, coriander, fried onions, and saffron milk. Repeat with the remaining rice and garnish again.</li>
<li>Dum (Steam cook):Cover the pan tightly with a lid (seal edges with dough if needed). Cook on very low flame for 15–20 minutes. Alternatively, place the pot over a tawa (griddle) to avoid direct heat.</li>
<li>Serve:Gently mix before serving. Enjoy hot with raita, salad, or boiled eggs!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Go ahead, take a bite, close your eyes, and let the flavors hug your soul.</p>
