    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Idly is a popular South Indian breakfast dish made from a fermented batter of rice and urad dal (black gram lentils).</p>
    <p> Its simplicity, ease of digestion, and versatility make it a favorite not just in the South, but across the country and even among international food lovers. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups parboiled rice (idly rice)</li>
        <li>1 cup urad dal (split black gram, skinned)</li>
        <li>1 tsp fenugreek seeds (optional, for better fermentation)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Water (as needed for soaking and grinding)</li>
        <li>A few drops of oil (for greasing idly molds)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Soaking: Rinse 1 cup of urad dal (black gram) and 2 cups of parboiled rice separately. You can also add 1 teaspoon of fenugreek seeds to the urad dal while soaking. Soak both the dal and rice in enough water for about 4 to 6 hours.</li>
<li>Grinding: After soaking, drain the water. First, grind the urad dal to a smooth and fluffy batter, adding water gradually. Then grind the rice to a slightly coarse texture. Mix both batters together in a large bowl. Add salt to taste and stir well to combine. The batter should be thick but pourable.</li>
<li>Fermentation: Cover the bowl and keep it in a warm place for 8 to 12 hours, or overnight. During this time, the batter will ferment and rise. You should see small bubbles and the volume will increase, indicating it's ready to use.</li>
<li>Steaming: Grease the idly molds with a few drops of oil. Pour the fermented batter into each mold, filling them about ¾ full. Steam them in an idly steamer or in a pressure cooker without the whistle for about 10 to 12 minutes on medium heat.</li>
<li>Serving: After steaming, allow the idlies to cool for a couple of minutes. Then, gently remove them using a spoon. Serve hot with coconut chutney, tomato chutney, or sambar for a delicious and nutritious meal.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy your soft, fluffy idlies fresh and warm — they’re little pillows of happiness on a plate! </p>
